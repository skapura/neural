# Pattern-based Branching CNN (experimental)

1. Finds patterns of filter map activations used to compress CNN models for edge computing.
2. Inserts pattern-based branches into pre-trained CNN models to improve performance in specific input subspaces.
3. Finds patterns of filter map activations associated with specific input subspaces to aid in Explainable AI (XAI).
